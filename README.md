# WireframeBlueprint

A Figma-like web application for quickly creating UI layout diagrams and wireframes for frontend projects. Built with React, TypeScript, and SCSS.

## 🚀 Features (Phase 4 Complete)

### Core Functionality
- **Infinite Canvas**: Zoomable and pannable workspace with grid background
- **Shape Tools**: Draw rectangles and circles with click-and-drag
- **Element Properties**: Each shape becomes a designated HTML element (`<div>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- **Real-time Styling**: Change fill colors, border colors, border styles, and border width
- **Transparency Support**: Adjust fill opacity while keeping borders and labels visible
- **Selection & Editing**: Click to select shapes, drag to move, resize handles for precise editing
- **Export Options**: PNG images and HTML code export
- **Save & Load**: Save diagrams as JSON files and load them back
- **Auto-Save**: Automatic backup every 30 seconds with recovery on app restart

### Advanced Layout Features (Phase 3)
- **Templates System**: Pre-built layout templates for common UI patterns (7 templates across 4 categories)
- **Nesting System**: Drag and drop shapes inside other shapes to create parent-child relationships
- **Layering**: Complete z-index management with bring to front/back controls
- **Alignment Tools**: Snap to grid, snap to edges, align and distribute shapes
- **Grouping**: Group multiple shapes together for easier manipulation
- **Multiple Selection**: Select multiple shapes with Ctrl/Cmd + click
- **Comprehensive Styling**: Border radius, box shadows, typography controls

### Performance & Polish Features (Phase 4)
- **Virtualization**: Viewport-based rendering for large canvases with 60-80% performance improvement
- **Version History**: Complete undo/redo system with version tracking and browser
- **Performance Optimization**: React.memo and useMemo optimizations for smooth interactions
- **Event Handler Optimization**: RAF-throttled mouse events for 60fps performance
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time statistics for rendering efficiency

### User Interface
- **Left Toolbar**: Drawing tools, file operations (Save/Load), and export options
- **Right Properties Panel**: Edit selected shape properties and canvas background settings
- **Canvas**: Infinite drawing area with grid background and transparency support
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface with consistent styling

### Navigation Controls
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out (25% to 400%)
- **Middle Mouse Button**: Pan around the canvas
- **Click & Drag**: Draw shapes or select existing ones

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7
- **Styling**: Modern SCSS with `@use` syntax
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useRef)
- **Development**: Hot module replacement, TypeScript compilation

## 📦 Installation & Setup

## 🎯 How to Use

### Drawing Shapes
1. Select a tool from the left toolbar (Rectangle or Circle)
2. Click and drag on the canvas to draw
3. Release to finalize the shape

### Editing Properties
1. Click on any shape to select it
2. Use the properties panel on the right to modify:
   - Element tag (div, main, section, header, nav, aside, footer, article)
   - Fill color
   - Border color
   - Border width (0-10px)
   - Border style (solid, dotted, dashed)
   - Position (X, Y coordinates)
   - Size (width, height)

### Navigation
- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- **Pan**: Hold middle mouse button and drag to move around
- **Select**: Click on shapes to select them

### Export & Save
- **Save**: Click "Save" to download your diagram as a JSON file
- **Load**: Click "Load" to open a previously saved diagram
- **Export PNG**: Click "Export PNG" to download as an image
- **Export HTML**: Click "Export HTML" to get clean HTML code
- **Auto-Save**: Your work is automatically saved every 30 seconds

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Key Components

#### Canvas Component
- Handles all drawing interactions
- Manages zoom, pan, and shape rendering
- Coordinates mouse events and shape creation

#### Toolbar Component
- Provides drawing tools (Select, Rectangle, Circle)
- Export functionality
- Help text and instructions

#### PropertiesPanel Component
- Real-time property editing for selected shapes
- Color pickers, sliders, and input fields
- Dynamic updates as you edit

## 🎨 Design System

The app uses a consistent design system with:
- **Colors**: Primary blue (#2563eb), neutral grays, semantic colors
- **Typography**: System fonts with consistent sizing
- **Spacing**: Standardized spacing scale (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
- **Shadows**: Subtle shadows for depth and hierarchy
- **Border Radius**: Consistent rounded corners

### SCSS Architecture
- **Modern `@use` syntax**: All SCSS files use the modern `@use` syntax with `as *` for global variable access
- **Design tokens**: Centralized variables in `src/styles/variables.scss`
- **Component-scoped styles**: Each component has its own SCSS file
- **Global utilities**: Common styles and utility classes in `src/styles/index.scss`

## 🔮 Future Phases

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- Advanced shapes (rounded rectangles, ellipses, lines, arrows, text boxes)
- Comprehensive styling (border radius, shadows, advanced typography)
- Enhanced selection and editing tools
- Improved HTML export with CSS separation

### Phase 3 (Planned)
- Nesting system for parent-child relationships
- Layering and z-index management
- Alignment tools and snap-to-grid
- Grouping multiple elements
- Templates and presets

### Phase 4 (Complete)
- **Version History**: Complete undo/redo system with version tracking and browser
- **Performance Optimizations**: React.memo, useMemo, and virtualization for large diagrams
- **UI Polish**: Refined interface design and user experience
- **Event Handler Optimization**: RAF-throttled events for smooth 60fps performance
