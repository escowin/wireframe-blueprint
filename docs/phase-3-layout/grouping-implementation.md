# Grouping System Implementation

## Overview

The grouping system allows users to combine multiple shapes into logical groups for easier manipulation and organization. Groups can be created, ungrouped, and visually managed through the toolbar interface.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Group Creation**: Select multiple shapes and group them together
- **Group Ungrouping**: Break apart groups to restore individual shapes
- **Visual Group Indicators**: Groups are displayed with dashed borders and labels
- **Group Selection**: Click on group boundaries to select all shapes in the group
- **Multiple Selection Support**: Groups work seamlessly with Ctrl/Cmd + click multi-selection

### User Interface
- **Grouping Toolbar**: Dedicated section in the toolbar with Group and Ungroup buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Groups are highlighted with blue dashed borders and labels
- **Button States**: Buttons are disabled when grouping operations are not possible

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

#### Group Interface
```typescript
interface Group {
  id: string
  name: string
  shapes: string[]  // Array of shape IDs in the group
  position: Point
  size: { width: number; height: number }
  zIndex: number
}
```

#### Updated Shape Interface
```typescript
interface Shape {
  // ... existing properties
  groupId?: string   // New property for grouping support
}
```

#### Updated CanvasState
```typescript
interface CanvasState {
  // ... existing properties
  groups: Group[]
  selectedShapeIds: string[]  // New property for multiple selection
  selectedGroupId: string | null
}
```

### Helper Functions

#### Group Creation
```typescript
createGroup(shapes: Shape[], selectedShapeIds: string[]): { shapes: Shape[], group: Group }
```
- Validates that at least 2 shapes are selected
- Calculates group bounds from selected shapes
- Assigns groupId to all selected shapes
- Returns updated shapes and new group object

#### Group Ungrouping
```typescript
ungroupShapes(shapes: Shape[], groups: Group[], groupId: string): { shapes: Shape[], groups: Group[] }
```
- Removes groupId from all shapes in the group
- Removes the group from the groups array
- Returns updated shapes and groups arrays

#### Validation Functions
```typescript
canGroupShapes(shapes: Shape[], selectedShapeIds: string[]): boolean
canUngroupShapes(shapes: Shape[], selectedShapeIds: string[]): boolean
getSelectedGroupIds(shapes: Shape[], selectedShapeIds: string[]): string[]
```

### Component Updates

#### Canvas Component
- **Group Selection**: Added logic to detect clicks on group boundaries
- **Group Rendering**: New `renderGroups()` function displays group indicators
- **Selection Management**: Updated to handle group selection alongside shape selection
- **Visual Feedback**: Groups show dashed borders and labels when selected

#### Toolbar Component
- **Grouping Section**: New section with Group and Ungroup buttons
- **Button States**: Buttons are disabled based on selection state
- **Action Handlers**: Connected to grouping functions in App component

#### App Component
- **State Management**: Updated to handle groups and multiple selection
- **Action Handlers**: New `handleGroupAction()` function processes grouping operations
- **Migration**: Updated migration function to handle new group-related properties

## User Workflow

### Creating a Group
1. Select multiple shapes using Ctrl/Cmd + click or drag selection
2. Click the "üì¶ Group" button in the toolbar
3. Shapes are grouped together with a visual indicator
4. The group is automatically selected

### Ungrouping Shapes
1. Select a group or shapes within a group
2. Click the "üì¶‚ùå Ungroup" button in the toolbar
3. The group is broken apart and shapes become individual again
4. Selection is cleared

### Group Selection
1. Click on the dashed border around a group to select all shapes in the group
2. Use Ctrl/Cmd + click to add/remove groups from multi-selection
3. Groups show visual feedback when selected

## Visual Design

### Group Indicators
- **Border**: Dashed blue border around group boundaries
- **Label**: Small label showing group name and shape count
- **Background**: Subtle blue tint to indicate group area
- **Selection**: Brighter blue when group is selected

### Button Design
- **Group Button**: Primary blue button with package icon
- **Ungroup Button**: Secondary button with package and X icons
- **Disabled State**: Grayed out when operation is not possible

## Error Handling

### Validation
- Minimum 2 shapes required for grouping
- Shapes must not already be in a group
- Groups must exist for ungrouping operations

### User Feedback
- Alert messages for invalid operations
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful error recovery

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Group Naming**: Allow users to rename groups
- **Nested Groups**: Support for groups within groups
- **Group Templates**: Save and reuse common group configurations
- **Group Operations**: Move, resize, and transform entire groups
- **Group Export**: Export groups as reusable components

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Groups**: Optimize rendering for groups with many shapes
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage with many groups
- **Selection Performance**: Optimize selection logic for complex scenarios

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Group creation with valid/invalid selections
- Group ungrouping with various group states
- Selection behavior with groups and individual shapes
- Visual rendering of group indicators
- Error handling for edge cases

### Manual Testing
- Create groups with different shape combinations
- Test group selection and multi-selection
- Verify visual feedback and button states
- Test error conditions and user feedback

## Conclusion

The grouping system provides a powerful way to organize and manipulate multiple shapes as a single unit. The implementation is robust, user-friendly, and integrates seamlessly with existing features like multiple selection and alignment tools.
