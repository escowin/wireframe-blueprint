# Resize Issues Documentation

## Issue Summary

Two critical issues have been identified with the resize functionality:

1. **Mousewheel Zoom Console Errors**: Zooming with mousewheel works but generates numerous console errors
2. **Click & Drag Resize Difficulty**: Resizing shapes by clicking and dragging on resize handles is very difficult/near impossible

## Issue 1: Mousewheel Zoom Console Errors

### Problem Description
When using the mousewheel to zoom in/out on the canvas, the zoom functionality works correctly, but the browser console is flooded with error messages:

```
Unable to preventDefault Canvas.tsx:327 inside passive event listener invocation.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs in the `handleWheel` function at line 327:

```typescript
const handleWheel = useCallback((e: React.WheelEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()  // This line causes the error
  // ... rest of zoom logic
}, [canvasState.zoom, setCanvasState])
```

**Technical Details**:
- Modern browsers treat wheel events as passive by default for performance reasons
- Passive event listeners cannot call `preventDefault()`
- The browser is trying to prevent default scroll behavior but can't due to the passive listener
- This creates a conflict between the custom zoom behavior and browser's scroll handling

### Impact
- **Functional**: Zoom still works despite the errors
- **Performance**: Console spam may impact debugging
- **User Experience**: No visible impact to users
- **Development**: Console errors make debugging other issues difficult

### Error Frequency
- **High**: Errors occur on every mousewheel event
- **Persistent**: Continues as long as mousewheel is used
- **Reproducible**: 100% reproducible on all modern browsers

## Issue 2: Click & Drag Resize Difficulty

### Problem Description
Attempting to resize shapes by clicking and dragging on the resize handles is extremely difficult and often impossible. Users report:

- Resize handles are hard to click accurately
- Dragging doesn't respond consistently
- Resize operation often fails to initiate
- Handles feel "sticky" or unresponsive

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Handle Size Too Small
```typescript
const handleSize = 8 // Size of resize handles
```
The current handle size of 8 pixels is too small for reliable interaction, especially on high-DPI displays.

#### 2. Handle Detection Logic Issues
The handle detection uses a simple distance check:
```typescript
const isOnHandle = (x: number, y: number, handleX: number, handleY: number) => {
  return Math.abs(x - handleX) <= handleSize && Math.abs(y - handleY) <= handleSize
}
```

**Problems**:
- **Coordinate Mismatch**: Handle positions are calculated in screen coordinates but click detection may have offset issues
- **Z-Index Conflicts**: Handles may be behind other elements
- **Event Bubbling**: Click events may not reach the handle detection logic

#### 3. Visual Handle Positioning
The resize handles are positioned with negative offsets:
```typescript
left: screenPos.x - 4,
top: screenPos.y - 4,
```

This creates a mismatch between visual position and click detection area.

#### 4. Mouse Event Handling
The resize operation depends on the mouse down handler detecting handle clicks, but:
- Handle clicks may not be properly detected
- Mouse move events may not be properly handled for resize operations
- State management may be interfering with resize operations

### Impact
- **Critical**: Core functionality is unusable
- **User Experience**: Users cannot resize shapes effectively
- **Feature Parity**: Resize functionality is essentially broken
- **Workflow**: Users must rely on other methods or workarounds

## Technical Investigation

### Console Error Analysis
```
Unable to preventDefault Canvas.tsx:327 inside passive event listener invocation.
```

**Location**: `src/components/Canvas.tsx:327`
**Event Type**: `onWheel`
**Browser Behavior**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) treat wheel events as passive

### Handle Detection Debugging
Current handle detection logic:
```typescript
// Check corners first, then edges
if (isOnHandle(screenPoint.x, screenPoint.y, screenPos.x, screenPos.y)) {
  setResizeHandle('nw')
  setIsResizing(true)
  setResizeStart({ point: canvasPoint, shape: clickedShape })
}
// ... more handle checks
```

**Issues Identified**:
1. Handle size too small (8px)
2. Coordinate calculation may be incorrect
3. No visual feedback during handle detection
4. No fallback for failed handle detection

### Mouse Event Flow
1. **Mouse Down**: Attempts to detect handle clicks
2. **Mouse Move**: Should handle resize operations
3. **Mouse Up**: Should finalize resize operations

**Potential Issues**:
- Handle detection failing in mouse down
- Mouse move not receiving events during resize
- State conflicts between different operations

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Mousewheel Console Errors

#### Option A: Remove preventDefault (Recommended)
```typescript
const handleWheel = useCallback((e: React.WheelEvent) => {
  // Remove e.preventDefault() - let browser handle scroll
  const zoomFactor = e.deltaY > 0 ? 0.9 : 1.1
  const newZoom = Math.max(0.25, Math.min(4, canvasState.zoom * zoomFactor))
  
  setCanvasState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    zoom: newZoom
  }))
}, [canvasState.zoom, setCanvasState])
```

#### Option B: Use CSS to Prevent Scroll
```css
.canvas {
  overflow: hidden;
  /* This prevents scroll without needing preventDefault */
}
```

### Solution 2: Fix Click & Drag Resize

#### Option A: Increase Handle Size
```typescript
const handleSize = 12 // Increase from 8 to 12 pixels
```

#### Option B: Improve Handle Detection
```typescript
// Add visual debugging for handle detection
const isOnHandle = (x: number, y: number, handleX: number, handleY: number) => {
  const distance = Math.sqrt((x - handleX) ** 2 + (y - handleY) ** 2)
  return distance <= handleSize
}
```

#### Option C: Add Handle Click Events
```typescript
// Add direct click handlers to resize handles
<div
  className="resize-handle resize-handle-nw"
  onMouseDown={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation()
    setResizeHandle('nw')
    setIsResizing(true)
    setResizeStart({ point: canvasPoint, shape: shape })
  }}
  // ... other props
/>
```

#### Option D: Improve Visual Feedback
- Add hover states for handles
- Add active states during resize
- Add visual indicators for handle detection

## Testing Strategy

### Mousewheel Error Testing
1. **Reproduce**: Use mousewheel on canvas
2. **Verify**: Check console for errors
3. **Fix**: Implement solution
4. **Test**: Verify zoom still works without errors

### Resize Handle Testing
1. **Reproduce**: Try to click and drag resize handles
2. **Debug**: Add console logs for handle detection
3. **Fix**: Implement handle improvements
4. **Test**: Verify resize works reliably

### Test Cases
1. **Handle Detection**: Click on each handle type
2. **Resize Operations**: Drag handles in all directions
3. **Edge Cases**: Very small shapes, shapes at canvas edges
4. **Performance**: Multiple rapid resize operations

## Priority Assessment

### High Priority
- **Mousewheel Console Errors**: Affects development experience
- **Resize Handle Detection**: Core functionality broken

### Medium Priority
- **Handle Size**: UX improvement
- **Visual Feedback**: UX improvement

### Low Priority

## Resolution Summary

### ✅ Issue 1: Mousewheel Console Errors - FIXED
**Solution Applied**: Removed `e.preventDefault()` from `handleWheel` function
**Result**: Console errors eliminated while zoom functionality preserved
**Code Change**:
```typescript
const handleWheel = useCallback((e: React.WheelEvent) => {
  // Removed e.preventDefault() - no longer needed
  const zoomFactor = e.deltaY > 0 ? 0.9 : 1.1
  const newZoom = Math.max(0.25, Math.min(4, canvasState.zoom * zoomFactor))
  
  setCanvasState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    zoom: newZoom
  }))
}, [canvasState.zoom, setCanvasState])
```

### ✅ Issue 2: Click & Drag Resize Difficulty - FIXED
**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Increased Handle Size**: From 8px to 12px for better usability
2. **Added Direct Click Handlers**: Each resize handle now has its own `onMouseDown` handler
3. **Improved Handle Positioning**: Adjusted offsets to match new size
4. **Enhanced CSS**: Updated styles for better visual feedback
5. **Fixed Resize Behavior**: Removed reference point updates during resize operations

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added resize handle click handler
const handleResizeHandleClick = useCallback((e: React.MouseEvent, handleType: string, shape: Shape) => {
  e.stopPropagation()
  // ... handle resize initiation
}, [screenToCanvas, setCanvasState])

// Updated handle size
const handleSize = 12 // Increased from 8px

// Added click handlers to each handle
<div
  className="resize-handle resize-handle-nw"
  onMouseDown={(e) => handleResizeHandleClick(e, 'nw', shape)}
  // ... other props
/>

// Fixed resize behavior - removed reference point updates
// DON'T update resizeStart here - this was causing the "tense" behavior
// setResizeStart({ point: canvasPoint, shape: originalShape })
```

## Final Status

### ✅ All Issues Resolved
1. **Mousewheel Console Errors**: Fixed by removing `preventDefault()`
2. **Resize Handle Usability**: Fixed by increasing size and adding direct click handlers
3. **Resize Behavior**: Fixed by removing reference point updates during operations
