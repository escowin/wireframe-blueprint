- **HTML Export**: Included as `box-shadow` CSS property

### 2. Typography System

#### Font Controls
- **Font Family**: Dropdown with 8 common fonts (Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, etc.)
- **Font Size**: Slider (8px to 72px)

- **Real-time Feedback**: All changes immediately visible on canvas

#### Visual Improvements
- **Responsive Layout**: Controls adapt to different panel sizes
- **Clear Labels**: Descriptive labels for all controls
- **Value Display**: Current values shown for all sliders

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Data Structure Updates
- **Shape Interface**: Extended with new styling and typography properties
- **Default Values**: Sensible defaults for all new properties
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing

#### Canvas Rendering
- **Real-time Updates**: All styling changes immediately reflected
- **Zoom Scaling**: All measurements scale properly with canvas zoom
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering for smooth interaction

#### HTML Export Enhancement
- **Inline Styles**: All styling and typography properties included as inline CSS
- **Semantic Structure**: Maintains clean HTML structure
- **Complete Export**: All visual properties preserved in exported HTML

#### Migration Support

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `src/types/index.ts` - Extended Shape interface
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx` - Updated shape creation and rendering
- `src/components/PropertiesPanel.tsx` - Added new styling controls
- `src/components/PropertiesPanel.scss` - Added CSS for new controls
- `src/utils/helpers.ts` - Enhanced HTML export with inline styles
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated migration function

### Documentation Files
- `docs/spec.md` - Updated to reflect completed features
- `docs/comprehensive-styling-typography.md` - New detailed documentation

- Real-time visual feedback
- Zoom-scaling support

### ✅ **Typography System**
- Font family selection (8 options)
- Font size control (8-72px)
- Font weight options (all weights)
- Font color picker
- Text alignment (4 options)

## What Was Skipped (As Requested)

### ❌ **Advanced Shapes**
- Rounded rectangles (can be achieved with border radius)
- Ellipses (can be achieved with border radius)
- Lines and arrows
- Text boxes

**Rationale**: These shapes are not commonly defined in stylesheets and can be derived from existing shapes with styling properties.

## Phase 2 Status: ✅ **COMPLETE**

Phase 2 is now fully complete with all planned features implemented:

1. ✅ **HTML Export** - Enhanced with inline styles
2. ✅ **Enhanced Element Properties** - Comprehensive HTML tag support
3. ✅ **Export Improvements** - PNG and HTML export with enhanced functionality
4. ✅ **CSS Label Display** - Toggle CSS class display in element labels
5. ✅ **Nested JSON Structure** - Hierarchical organization for better data readability
6. ✅ **Layer Management** - Z-index management and layer panel
7. ✅ **Selection & Editing** - Multi-select, drag to move, resize handles
8. ✅ **File Management** - Save/Load system with JSON format
9. ✅ **Auto-save** - Background saving every 30 seconds
10. ✅ **Comprehensive Styling** - Border radius, opacity, shadows
11. ✅ **Typography** - Font family, size, weight, color, alignment options

## Next Steps: Phase 3

With Phase 2 complete, the project is ready to move to Phase 3: Layout & Hierarchy, which will focus on:

- **Nesting System**: Drag and drop shapes inside other shapes
- **Alignment Tools**: Snap to grid, snap to edges, distribution tools
