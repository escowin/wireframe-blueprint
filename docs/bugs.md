# QA Bug Report: Canvas Drawing Functionality Issues

## 🐛 Bug Summary
**Title**: Canvas drawing tools non-functional - text selection interferes with shape creation  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Date Reported**: [Current Date]  
**Date Resolved**: [Current Date]

## 📋 Bug Description

### **Issue**
Users were unable to draw shapes on the canvas despite being able to select drawing tools (Rectangle, Circle). When attempting to click and drag to draw, text would get highlighted instead of creating shapes.

### **Expected Behavior**
- User selects Rectangle or Circle tool
- User clicks and drags on canvas
- Shape preview appears while dragging
- Shape is created when mouse is released

### **Actual Behavior**
- User selects Rectangle or Circle tool
- User clicks and drags on canvas
- Text gets highlighted/selected instead of drawing
- No shapes are created
- Console shows errors related to invalid event handlers

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Issues Identified**

1. **Missing Dependencies in useCallback Hooks**
   - `handleMouseMove`, `handleMouseUp`, `handleWheel`, `handleMouseMovePan`, and `handleMouseDown` functions were missing `setCanvasState` in their dependency arrays
   - This caused stale closures and prevented proper state updates during drawing operations

2. **Text Selection Interference**
   - Browser's default text selection behavior was interfering with drawing mouse events
   - No CSS or JavaScript prevention of text selection during drawing operations

3. **Invalid React Event Handler**
   - `onSelectStart` event handler was used but is not a valid React event prop
   - This caused console errors on page load

4. **Shape Click Interference**
   - Existing shapes had click handlers that could interfere with drawing operations
   - No distinction between drawing mode and selection mode

## ��️ Technical Details

### **Files Affected**
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
- `src/components/Canvas.scss`
- `src/styles/index.scss`

### **Code Issues**

#### **1. Missing Dependencies**
```typescript
// Before (causing stale closures)
}, [isDrawing, drawStart, currentTool, screenToCanvas, canvasState.shapes.length])

// After (fixed)
}, [isDrawing, drawStart, currentTool, screenToCanvas, canvasState.shapes.length, setCanvasState])
```

#### **2. Text Selection Prevention**
```scss
// Added CSS prevention
.canvas-container, .canvas {
  user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
  -moz-user-select: none;
  -ms-user-select: none;
}
```

#### **3. Invalid Event Handler**
```typescript
// Removed invalid handler
onSelectStart={(e) => e.preventDefault()} // ❌ Not a valid React event

// Added proper prevention
document.body.style.userSelect = 'none' // ✅ Dynamic prevention
```

## ✅ Resolution

### **Fixes Implemented**

1. **Fixed useCallback Dependencies**
   - Added `setCanvasState` to all relevant dependency arrays
   - Ensured proper state updates during drawing operations

2. **Prevented Text Selection**
   - Added `user-select: none` CSS to canvas containers
   - Implemented dynamic `document.body.style.userSelect` manipulation
   - Added proper cleanup to restore text selection after drawing

3. **Removed Invalid Event Handler**
   - Removed `onSelectStart` event handler that was causing console errors
   - Replaced with proper text selection prevention methods

4. **Improved Event Handling**
   - Added left mouse button check (`e.button !== 0`)
   - Prevented shape clicks during drawing mode
   - Added minimum size validation for shapes (10px minimum)

5. **Added Cleanup and Debugging**
   - Added `useEffect` cleanup to restore text selection on component unmount
   - Added console logs for debugging drawing state
   - Added proper error handling for small shapes

## 🧪 Testing Results

### **Test Cases**

| Test Case | Before Fix | After Fix | Status |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| Select Rectangle tool | ✅ Tool selected | ✅ Tool selected | ✅ PASS |
| Click and drag to draw | ❌ Text highlighted | ✅ Shape preview appears | ✅ PASS |
| Release mouse to create shape | ❌ No shape created | ✅ Shape created successfully | ✅ PASS |
| Select Circle tool | ✅ Tool selected | ✅ Tool selected | ✅ PASS |
| Draw circle shape | ❌ Text highlighted | ✅ Circle created successfully | ✅ PASS |
| Console errors on load | ❌ Invalid event handler error | ✅ No errors | ✅ PASS |
| Select existing shapes | ✅ Shapes selectable | ✅ Shapes selectable | ✅ PASS |

### **Performance Impact**
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Improved responsiveness due to fixed state management
- ✅ Reduced console noise

## 🔄 Regression Prevention

### **Prevention Measures**
1. **Code Review Checklist**
   - ✅ Verify all `useCallback` dependencies are complete
   - ✅ Check for invalid React event handlers
   - ✅ Ensure proper text selection prevention for drawing tools

2. **Testing Checklist**
   - ✅ Test drawing functionality with all tools
   - ✅ Verify no console errors on page load
   - ✅ Test shape selection and editing
   - ✅ Verify text selection prevention during drawing

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - ✅ Updated README with modern SCSS architecture
   - ✅ Added debugging information for future troubleshooting

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **React Dependencies**: Always ensure `useCallback` dependencies include all used functions and state setters
2. **Event Handling**: Verify React event handler validity before implementation
3. **Text Selection**: Implement comprehensive text selection prevention for drawing applications
4. **Debugging**: Add console logs for complex mouse interaction debugging
5. **Cleanup**: Always provide proper cleanup for global DOM manipulations

### **Best Practices Established**
- Use `user-select: none` CSS for drawing canvases
- Implement dynamic text selection prevention during drawing
- Add proper cleanup effects for global style changes
- Validate shape dimensions before creation
- Separate drawing and selection event handling
